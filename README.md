# Rust Learning Journey

Welcome to my Rust learning repository! This space contains all the content and code examples I’ve created and assimilated throughout my journey of learning the Rust programming language. Here, you’ll find tutorials, code snippets, and project configurations that reflect my progress and understanding of Rust.

Feel free to explore, learn alongside me, and contribute if you’d like!

## Topics Covered:
- Basics of Rust
- Loops, conditionals, and functions
- Memory management (ownership, borrowing)
- Error handling
- Cargo and project setup
- Working with tools like VS Code for Rust development

I hope you find this repository helpful, whether you're also learning Rust or just exploring its potential.
